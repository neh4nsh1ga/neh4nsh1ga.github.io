# Welcome. I’m still piecing myself together.
 

I'm a 2rd Chonnam university student who happens to be in love with computers. My current interests are in **AI and Cybersecurity**. When I’m not reading papers or writing code, I actively participate in CTF, wargames. mainly specializing in reverse engineering.

Besides coding, I studied art. I still keep that side alive through my fascination with traditional Chinese opera, film, and visual aesthetics. Outside computer, I enjoy exploring obscure corners of the internet the digital scrapyards where forgotten projects and communities still linger.

*I'm multilingual, speaking Korean natively and English fluently.* I can read, listen to, and communicate in Chinese and Russian to a fair degree. _I’m also studying Latin and Spanish — for my love of tacos and satans alike._

My previous major, chemical engineering, remain as a special place as my third-favorite field of knowledge.


This blog is a collection of personal notes, research logs, and reflections. While some posts aim to share knowledge, others track my learning journey. Expect a mix of English and Korean depending on which language feels most natural for the topic.
